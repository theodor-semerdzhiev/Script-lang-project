# Script-lang-project
A homebrewed scripting language

This was an attempt to build an interpreter for my own scripting language. I used ZERO libraries and built everything myself from scratch. This project was really just meant as a learning project.

The goal was to parse the code and then create a syntax tree data structure which would be iterated through and the instructions would be run. However, I never got around to doing this. Nevertheless, here is a list of the different things I built:

- Several Parsing algorithms
- Custom implementation of Hash maps
- Dynamic type system (that actually works!!)
- Custom implementation of a wide range of data structures
- A complex math expression parser
